## Deploy to Azure Container Instance from Azure Container Registry using a CI/CD Azure DevOps Pipeline  and Terraform

I am going to show using an Azure DevOps Pipeline and Terraform how you can deploy to your Azure Container Instance and setting up the pipeline to build a new Image and enabling CI/CD when you push to the repository - the pipeline will build a new image and deploy the updated image to the Azure Container Instance.
